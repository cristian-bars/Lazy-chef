# LazyChef

## Easy recipes for those with no idea

During my last 3 weeks at Skylab Coders Academy I made this Full-stack app with React Native.

## To run the project (scripts)
After you clone the project go inside each folder [client/lazyChef, server] and run the command npm install on both.

The scripts you can run with npx (or yarn) are:

### `npx react-native start`
In client/lazyChef file to start metro
 
### `npx react-native run-android`
In client/lazyChef file to init android emulator

### or

### `npx react-native run-ios`
In client/lazyChef file to init xcode emulator
 
### `npm start`
In server file to start the back-end
 
### `npm test`
To see unit & component tests on both files
